  body: "## About Us, Our Breeding Program, and Our Mini Aussiedoodle Puppies\nAll
    of our mini aussiedoodle puppies from are born in our home. They are loved, nurtured,
    and educated with kindness and compassion. Your pup will be adored by our friends,
    family, and our personal pets (fur nannies!). They have been taught people and
    dog manners and most importantly are ready for you to love them as much as we
    do!\n\nWhen we were searching for our own pets we were learned right away what
    a frustrating and often confusing experience it could be. We went through the
    ringer with commercial breeders, had health concerns with puppies in stores, stores
    not willing to tell us where the puppy came from or how they were raised, and
    deep down knowing we just simply did not wanting to support unethical practices.\n\nNot
    being able to find definitive answers and then having to settle for some variables
    while missing out on others led us to develop our breeding program here at Miami
    Mini Doodles. We knew we had to build a program that would help bring the love
    and joy of our beloved four-pawed family members to the homes of others. We believe
    that dogs not only add incredible value to your and family's lives but the unlimited
    and unconditional love that they offer us is therapeutic and literally saves lives.
    \n\nOur Aussiedoodle puppies are raised in our home and not a kennel. Not in the
    back room of our home, tucked in a garage out of sight. When we say \"in home\"
    we literally mean in the middle of our open floor plan living room surrounded
    by our Family all day, every day, until they join your Family. Because we hold
    and love on these Aussiedoodle puppies daily, they learn to trust and love people.
    \n\nWe follow \"Badass Breeder\" Advanced Puppy Curriculum, a program proven to
    raise puppies to be empowered, honored and respected from birth to placement.
    Puppies are raised to believe in themselves and be the best they can be through
    guiding emotional responses, meeting their innate needs in order, building confidence through
    intentional and purposeful curriculum and handling that aligns to their sensitive
    developmental benchmarks and lastly evaluating each puppy prior to placement to ensure
    their voice is heard and they are honored and respected. \n\nWe perform \"Early
    Neurological Stimulation\" and \"Early Scent Introduction\" from day 3 to 16, which
    benefits the puppy's health both physically and emotionally.  ENS and ESI are
    scientifically developed methods comprised of simple exercises to which you expose
    puppies from days 3-16 to help aid their development, resilience, and coping mechanisms.
    These early puppy stimulation exercises pay off huge dividends in the long run!\n\nPuppies
    are temperament tested at 6-7 weeks of age. The temperament testing assesses energy
    level, confidence, motivation, toy/prey drive, assertiveness, resiliency, sight/sound
    sensitivity, touch tolerance, and human focus. Knowing these traits allows us
    to honor each puppy's unique needs and match each puppy's temperament to their
    family's lifestyle and preferences so that these matches last a lifetime! This
    system empowers families and individuals to select their puppies with a holistic
    approach that goes beyond beauty and aesthetics. \n\nWe are very transparent in
    how we raise our pups! You won't only see highly edited photos of your new puppy
    online. We show you the nitty gritty and explain what we are doing and why we
    are doing it. You can follow along with HUNDREDS of videos as your new puppy goes
    from Day 1 to Go- Home day!\n\nIt is our goal to match you with your dream dog
    all while making this process painless, informational, professional, and supportive
    for individuals and families throughout the lifetime of your pet. \n\nIf you have
    any questions of want to hop on the wait list please submit your [puppy application](https://www.miniaussiedoodle.dog/application).

  body: "## How To Reserve & Prices\nOur beautiful four-legged future soulmate puppies
    from our Spring 2024 litter range from $1,800 to $2,400. \n\nAs a Veteran Family
    owned business, we are also extremely grateful for our Country and are very thankful
    for our military, their families, and the countless sacrifices they have made
    and make. We offer a 10% reduction in price for our active-duty, those actively
    enrolled in service, and for our Veterans.  \n\n> The prices listed do not include
    breeding rights, which are only granted to approved breeders/programs. If you're
    interested in obtaining full rights, please reach out to us for more information.\n\n[Click
    here to fill out our puppy application.](https://www.miniaussiedoodle.dog/application)\n\n**Our
    policy on pricing for waitlists is as follows:**\nThe price quoted to you in your
    first message or email from us will be the price you pay for your puppy provided
    that:\n \n- A deposit of $300 is due to secure your position on the waiting list.
    Your place on the waiting list will be determined by the order that the deposits
    are received.\n\n<!--- \nCome 'Picking Day', usually when your puppy is around
    4 weeks old, you can come to meet all of our puppies in person or FaceTime/Zoom
    and choose your puppy! At this time an additional payment of $300 toward the purchase
    price is required within 3 days of acceptance of 'your pick of the litter.' $500
    will be deducted from the remaining balance. \n--->\nThe remaining balance is
    due in full when your puppy is 8 weeks old ( the usual 'Go Home Day' for your
    new puppy). \n\nWe know that families often plan a lot of activities and vacations
    around the arrival of a new puppy and are happy to give your new puppy lots of
    extra love and attention free of charge for an additional few weeks. Any additional
    days past 11 weeks old will accrue a nominal $15 per day boarding fee. Please
    discuss any concerns regarding travel plans, etc. We are very happy to work with
    you to make sure it's the best time for you and your puppy to transition into
    their new homes!\n\n**Our policy on waitlist deposits is as follows:**\nYour position
    on the waitlist is determined by the date the waiting list deposit is received.\n\nIf
    you cancel your placement on the list for any reason we will refund your deposit
    minus a $100 admin fee. We only want to accept a deposit from you if you are absolutely
    certain that we are the right program for you!\n\nIf you cancel your placement
    on the list after being allocated and accepting a puppy your payment(s) to date
    is/are non-refundable but will be held for you as a credit on your next puppy
    from our program. For example, you place a deposit but something comes up where
    you are not able to bring a puppy home at that time. We are happy to automatically
    place you on the next litter's waitlist or a waitlist of a future litter that
    best suits your time frame. You can carry your deposit over for up to the next
    two litters (usually 8 to 12 months) that are born. If you choose to back out
    of adopting a puppy from us at that point, your full deposit will be forfeited.
    \n\nTo reserve a spot on our waitlist for a future litter or to apply for a puppy
    from our current litter, you can complete the puppy application below. Please
    remember that you are not officially on the list until payment is received!\n\n[Please

  body: "## What is an Aussiedoodle?\n\n>  …perfect blend of intelligence, beauty,
    and temperament. - dogtime.com\n\n### Petite-Mini Aussiedoodle Breed Traits &
    Characteristics:\n\n**_At a glance: _**\nHeight (at shoulder) : 10- 12 inches\nWeight:
    _11-18  lbs_\nLifespan: _12-15 years_\n\n\n**Introduction:**\nA mix of the charming
    Australian Shepherd/Mini-American Shepherd and the elegant Poodle, the Aussiedoodle
    has quickly become a favorite among dog lovers across the globe. With their smarts,
    boundless energy, and striking good looks, these delightful hybrids combine the
    best traits of their parents. But what exactly sets Aussiedoodles apart and makes
    them such wonderful companions? Join us as we explore the captivating world of
    Aussiedoodles and uncover what makes them truly special pets.\n\n\n**Origins and
    History of Aussiedoodles: **\nMeet the Aussiedoodle, or as we fondly call them,
    the adorable “Aussiepoo”! This designer breed has been capturing hearts for over
    20 years, and for good reason. Whether it’s the standard, Mini, or Petite Mini,
    Aussiedoodles are delightful bundles of energy and love. Created to blend the
    Poodle’s smarts and hypoallergenic coat with the Australian Shepherd’s agility
    and herding skills, they come in a range of sizes that fit perfectly into any
    home. The result? An incredibly intelligent, trainable, and active pup that absolutely
    thrives in a family setting. With their compact size, Mini and Petite Mini Aussiedoodles
    bring all the charm of their larger counterparts in a more petite package, making
    them ideal companions for any lifestyle.\nTemperament and Behavior of Aussiedoodles:\n\nAussiedoodles
    are famous for their smarts and lively spirit. These quick learners are always
    ready to please and generally shine in obedience training. Social by nature, Aussiedoodles
    form strong bonds with their families and get along great with other pets. Their
    playful and gentle demeanor makes them excellent with children, making these pups
    a perfect fit for families of all sizes.\n \n> With their easy-going nature and
    love for learning, Aussiedoodles make great therapy dogs and can adapt well to
    different family environments. - Daily Paws\n\n**Health and Care of a Petite-Mini
    Aussiedoodle: **\nJust like any other breed, Aussiedoodles can be prone to certain
    health issues. These may include hip dysplasia, epilepsy, and some skin conditions.
    All of our breeding dogs have been genetically tested and cleared for heritable
    diseases to help bring you peace of mind. Regardless of genetics, regular vet
    visits and a balanced diet are key to keeping your Aussiedoodle in tip-top shape!
    Their no to low-shedding coats are perfect for allergy sufferers.  We do recommend
    regular brushing, at least once a week, to ensure mats are prevented and removed
    promptly. \n\nConsidering the lifespan of both parent breeds, the estimated lifespan
    for their offspring (Mini Aussiedoodle) would typically range from 12 to 15 years.
    This range can be influenced by factors such as diet, exercise, healthcare, and
    genetic predispositions.\nMini Aussiedoodles, benefiting from hybrid vigor, might
    sometimes live slightly longer than the average for their parent breeds. However,
    it’s essential to provide them with a healthy lifestyle and regular veterinary
    care to maximize their lifespan.\n\n> The Aussiedoodle is known for being smart,
    playful, and very affectionate. They thrive on attention and are great family
    pets. - akc.org\n\n**Training and Exercise Needs of Petite-Mini Aussiedoodle:** \nWith
    their sharp minds petite-mini Aussiedoodles need plenty of mental stimulation
    in addition to physical exercise. While their energy needs are significantly less
    than that of a standard or miniature size Australian Shepherd, a fun mix of walks,
    playtime, and engaging challenges like puzzle toys can keep your petite-mini Aussiedoodle
    happy and well-behaved. These pups are highly trainable and thrive on positive
    reinforcement methods like treats and praise. \n\n\n<center> \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_</center>\n\n\nIf

  body: "## Health Guarantee \n\nOur Commitment to Your Puppy's Well-being\n\nAt Miami
    Mini Doodles, we prioritize the health and well-being of all of our mini aussiedoodle
    puppies. We guarantee that all our puppies are in excellent health and free from
    any visible signs of infection or contagious diseases when they go home. All of
    our puppies are thoroughly dewormed at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks and examined by a
    licensed Veterinarian and given their first set of puppy shots. \n\nWe offer 30
    days of free pet insurance through Trupanion for added peace of mind in protecting
    your new puppy from any new unexpected injuries or illnesses. \n\nWe are proud
    to stand by our 1-year genetic health guarantee. If, within the first year of
    your new aussiedoodle's life, a licensed veterinarian diagnoses your puppy with
    a life-threatening or severely disabling congenital/genetic defect, we will either
    refund the full purchase price or cover the treatment costs up to the purchase
    price at a vet clinic approved by us. We may request a second opinion from a veterinarian
    of our choice, at our expense. \n\nPlease keep in mind that this warranty does
    not cover undetermined or inconclusive diagnoses, and diseases likely caused by
    environmental factors such as diet, chemicals, or trauma.\n\nIn the extremely
    unfortunate event of your puppy's death, if you request a refund, you must arrange
    for a necropsy performed by a qualified veterinarian at your own expense to determine
    the cause of death. Refunds will be provided if the death was due to a genetic
    problem or an illness the puppy had at the time of purchase. For this reason,
    we recommend having your own veterinarian examine your puppy within 72 hours of
    purchase.\n\nTo ensure the long-term health of your puppy, we recommend following
    a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, minimal exposure to food additives,
    and spaying/neutering at 6-12 months of age. It is also advised to limit the use
    of veterinary drugs (such as flea and heartworm treatments, vaccinations, and
    worms) to the necessary dosage and frequency to safeguard your pet's health.\n\nLastly,
    we provide a **lifetime** rehoming guarantee for your puppy. If, at any point
    in your puppy's life, you find yourself unable to care for them, you can contact
    us. We urge you never to surrender your puppy to a shelter, under any circumstances.
    We will take FULL responsibility for the puppy we chose to bring into this world
    if you ever need us to.\n\nThank you for considering us as your trusted source
    for a healthy and well-cared-for miniature aussiedoodle puppy!\n\nAny questions
